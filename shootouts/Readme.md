## Shootout?

At chemometrics meet-ups it's pretty common that people individually tackle a challenge problem and submit their results in what is called a 'shoot-out'. Here I am using that term lightly. The files in this directory serve as internal tests to ensure that all the methods at least run and give 'expected' results.

The methods showcased here don't feature real analysis' or real model building skills. There are no CV's for hyperparameters, no intelligent sampling methods, no model tuning, etc. Again this is an internal test-bed. I included these files because they may help an end-user get an idea for a 'template' for running a gambit of methods on some data.
